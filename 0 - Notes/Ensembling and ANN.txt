Ensembling Techniques: Creates multiple model and combine their prediction to produce improved result
Bagging
Boosting

Bagging- Bootstrap Aggregating

Boosting

Weak Learner-

Strong Learner-

1. Adaboost Algorithm
2. Gradient Boosting
3. Xg Boost


TensorFlow:It is open source framework developed b Google Brain Team

pip install tensorflow

Tensor:It is mathematicl obect thatis asociated ith scalars, vectors and matrices

Rank: It refer to no of dimension 
	scalar-rank 0 tensor
	vectors- rank1 tensor
	matrices - rank 2 tensor
Shape: It refers to size of dimension
	shape(3,2)- 2D with 3 rows and 2 columnss
	shape(3,2,5)- 3D with 3 matrices each with 2 rows and 5 columns
	shape(2,)-1d with 2 elements
	shape()-
Data type- int, string, float,bool

functions
tf.constant()- Create tensors with constant values
tf.variable()- create tensors whose values can be cnages during excution of program
tf.zeros()- Create tensors with all element set to Zero
tf.one()- Creates tensors with all element set to Ones
tf.fill()- Creates tensors filled with a specified values


ANN- Artificial Neural Network


Initialization
Activaton

Steps in ANN
1 Gather Data
2 Preprocess the Gathered Data
3. Import  DL libraries  
  Sequential- load/ initialise the model
  Dense- To add the network layers
4. Initialise the model
5. Add Input Layers - while creating input layers you need to send some argumnets
  ( No of Input neurons, Weight Initialization Strategy, Activation function)
6 Add Hidden Layer
  ( No of Input neurons, Weight Initialization Strategy, Activation function)

7. Output Layer
  ( No of Input neurons, Weight Initialization Strategy, Activation function)

  Regression( 1, relu/linear)
  Binary( 1, Sigmoid/threshold)
  Categoircal( based on categories you will have no of neurons , Softmax)
8 Compile the model
  (loss-mse/binary_crossentroy/categorical_crossentropy,Optimizer-adam, Metrics- mse(regression)/accuracy(classification)
9.fit the model(train, batch size, no of times to train the model)
10 test the model.
