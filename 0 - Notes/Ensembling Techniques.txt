TensorFlow:It is open source framework developed b Google Brain Team

pip install tensorflow

Tensor:It is mathematicl obect thatis asociated ith scalars, vectors and matrices

Rank: It refer to no of dimension 
	scalar-rank 0 tensor
	vectors- rank1 tensor
	matrices - rank 2 tensor
Shape: It refers to size of dimension
	shape(3,2)- 2D with 3 rows and 2 columnss
	shape(3,2,5)- 3D with 3 matrices each with 2 rows and 5 columns
	shape(2,)-1d with 2 elements
	shape()-
Data type- int, string, float,bool
