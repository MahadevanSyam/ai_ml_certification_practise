Data Preprocessing- To Transform the raw data into useful and efficient format

Major Tasks:
1. Data Integration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Transformation

Data Cleaning
1  Missing Values
	Delete the row /cell
	Impute values	
2. Noise
3. Handling  Outliers
	2,3,4,6,5,8,12,20,86-- 
	Box Plot
4. Handling Duplicates
5. Inconsistencies from Data

Data Transformation
1. Handling Categorical Data
two type of Categorical Feature
1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
Techniques of handling Categorical Data
1. Map()
2. Label Encoding
	We have to import Label Encode class from Scikit Learn Library
3.OneHot Encoding

2. Handling Imbalance Data

Imbalance Data- Dataset is imbalance if in target column , observation in one class is higher as compared to other class

Class with higher Observation is Majority Class


Class with less Observation is Minority Class

Undersampling
Oversampling
-SMOTE- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques

Dimension Reduction
Feature Engneering

Scaling
Normalisation- Min Max Scaling ( 0-1)
Stardardisation- Standard Scaler (Mean -0, Std-1)


Split Data
x- Independent Feature
y- Dependent Feature

70-30/ 80-20
Train Test Split
Training Dataset
Test Dataset

Train- Test Split- Evaluate the performance of the Model

Train Dataset- Used to train the model
x_train- Features for training data
y_train- Dependent variable for training data

test dataset- Used to evaluate the fitted/trained model
x_test- Features for test data
y_test- Depedent variable for testing data (actual values)

for splitting the dataset we use train_test_split()

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split() 

x_train, y_train,x_test,y_test=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=0)
